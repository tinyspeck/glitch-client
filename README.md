intention is to dedicate these works to the public domain and make them freely 
available to all, without restriction.

All files are provided AS-IS. Tiny Speck cannot provide any support to help you 
bring these assets into your own projects. Many of these files are not 
structured in a standard, straightforward way, and they may take a bit of 
your time and work to understand.

Note: the Glitch logo and trademark are *not* among the things we are making 
available under this license. Only items in the files explicitly included 
herein are covered.

There is no obligation to link or credit the works, but if you do, please link 
to <a href="http://glitchthegame.com">glitchthegame.com</a>, our permanent 
"retirement" site for the game and these assets. Of course, links/shoutouts to 
Tiny Speck (<a href="http://tinyspeck.com">tinyspeck.com</a>) and/or Slack

## What you'll find in here: ##

All of the source code for Glitch's Flash-based browser client.

## What is not included ##

A working version of the game. :( 

The Glitch client requires a Glitch server to work, and there are no longer any
Glitch servers for it to use. This code is provided mainly for instructional 
and reference purposes; if you are attempting to develop something with any of 
the asset repositories, the client implementation may be a valuable resource.
